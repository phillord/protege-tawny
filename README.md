Protege-Tawny
=============

This is a plugin which brings the power of
[Tawny-OWL](https://github.com/phillord/tawny-owl) and
[Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) to Protege.

This is ALPHA software. It uses a modified version of swingrepl, a snapshot
version of Tawny-OWL, which in turn uses a different version of the OWL API
from protege, so while it **will** work in the current release of Protege, it
will some times crash.
